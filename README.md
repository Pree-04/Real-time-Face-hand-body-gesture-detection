## Real-time-Face-hand-body-gesture-detection
Real-time body, face and hand gesture detection from live webcam feed - A Computer Vision and Image Processing project.
This project demonstrates real-time detection of body poses, faces, and hand landmarks using MediaPipe and OpenCV. It captures live video feed from a webcam and processes it to display detected keypoints.
